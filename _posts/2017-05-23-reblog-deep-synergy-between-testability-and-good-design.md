- Testable code does not imply Good design.
- Good design should imply testable code.

But if you think your code base have a Good Design and you canâ€™t easily test your code, then you can be biased about good design from your point of view.

However real good SOLID design imply easily testable code.

Why am I talking about this? Because in video below Michael Feathers really nicely explains that into big depth. After watching this I got a lot of nice guides how to design better for easily testable code.

Enjoy watching it!
