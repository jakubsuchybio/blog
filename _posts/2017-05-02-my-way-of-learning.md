I don’t read books. Heck I’ve read only like 4 books in my life from start to finish. So how do I learn? I watch and listen. It’s that simple! Most often the tempo of the speaker is too slow and my brain is wandering off to other thoughts. So I am compensating that by speeding the video or track up a bit. My best speed-up range is from 1.4x to 1.9x. It depends on how fast can you process the speaker, if he is understandable at that speed and how am I accommodated to that certain speed. I often start slower and then speed up. Then I am 100% on the topic and that is the most effective way for me to learn something.
